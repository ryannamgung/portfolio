        <div class="description">
          <p> Recently graduated from Flatiron School, Iâ€™m a Full Stack developer with a passion for building easy to use, state of the art websites and applications implementing clean and efficient code. With experience in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React and a background in data analytics, I discovered web development through my enthusiasm for technology, curiosity of how things work, and my love for the idea of being given a blank canvas, a problem and countless ways to solve it! I bring strong skills in collaborative and agile development that help team-driven, tightly knit companies efficiently develop current and fit for market solutions.
