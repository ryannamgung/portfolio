              </h3>
                <h5> October 2018 </h5>
                    <p> This e-commerce site utlizes a React-Redux frontend with material-ui for styling, and a RAILS postresql backend for storing the large quantities of clothing information. You can cycle through the site adding goods you like to your shopping cart. You have the option of then removing them later if you don't wish to complete your purchase. Otherwise, you can checkout your goods completing your purchase.

              </h3>
                <h5> September 2018 </h5>

                  <p> One of my recent projects involved making a jumping game using React and the Phaser library for the frontend, and RAILS postresql for the backend API storage. The end result was a fully functional game where the user could jump from platform to platform, and avoid obstacles to get to a portal. The portal then teleports the user to another stage and then the user must get to the final teleport location.

                  <p> A Ruby of Rails based application with SQLite data storage. The purpose of the site is comfortable scheduling of music lessons. Login & signup functionality for both student and teacher are done using Bcrypt tokens and cookie state preservation. Teachers have the ability to create appointments, and students can book appointments from an available schedules list. Both parties can also edit their profiles.

                <h5> December 2017 </h5>
                  <p> Used Elucids and the RSA prime number algorithm to generate large prime numbers that could be used to form public and private keys. Shared the public keys with the recipient and sent them a message which is turned into a jumble of letters and numbers by the algorithm. Then the recipient can decrypt this message using the key and thus completing the encrypted messaging process.
